    <li>calvin: here i am, waiting for the bus. eleven more years of school to go. then colllege, then maybe graduate school,
        then work until i die.</li>
    <li>what kind of world is this?! you only get three years to be a kid??</li>
    <li>what about exploring and discovering and playing? those things are important too!</li>
    <li>hobbes: well, you still have afternoons and weekends.</li>
    <li>calvin: that's when i watch tv.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    the obvious reaction to this comic strip is to laugh at calvin's hypocrisy: he laments the fact that he has no time
    to 'be a kid', but then proceeds to use the time he does have to simply watch tv rather than 'explore, discover, and
    play' as he said he wants to. but i think two things are important here: one, even if he is being hypocritical, he still
    raises a very valid point. and two, is he really being that hypocritical?
</p>
<p>
    the first i won't go into, as it seems kinda self explanatory: in the world we live in, even a six year old like calvin
    has his future planned out for him, with little to no room for change or choice.
</p>
<p>
    the second point is more interesting. is calvin really being hypocritical here? the answer would seem to be yes, at first
    glance: he complains about lack of time for 'exploring and discovering and playing', but then the time he does have for those
    things, afternoons and weekends, he does not use. instead, he simply watches tv then. this seems less hypocritical if we
    change his dialogue a bit:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>calvin: here i am, waiting for the bus. eleven more years of school to go. then colllege, then maybe graduate school,
        then work until i die.</li>
    <li>what kind of world is this?! you only get three years to be allowed to do what you want to??</li>
    <li>what about being free to choose how you spend your time! that's important too!</li>
    <li>hobbes: well, you still have afternoons and weekends.</li>
    <li>calvin: that's when i watch tv.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    this doesn't seem like a contradiction at all now: calvin wants to watch tv on afternoons and weekends, so he does. and he
    complains that the only time he has to do what he wants like this is on afternoons and weekends, which seems perfectly
    natural. calvin likes to choose how he spends his time, rather than having it chosen for him, and he is rightfully mad that
    this wish cannot be fulfilled.
