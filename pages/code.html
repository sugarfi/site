    believe it or not, i also do code sometimes! i like to work with obscure or lesser known
    languages, or small languages with a lot of limitations; they make things more fun and challenging.
    i try not to worry too much about writing 'good' code per se: i write code for myself, not
    for anyone who happens to be judging it. if i'm happy with it, i publish it. maybe that means that
    the code is good enough for me, or maybe it means i'm more worried about the output than the code
    and so i wrote conventionally 'bad' code. you can decide for yourself what you think of it:

        qyre is a work-in-progress experimental os, based around the idea of using 'nodes' as a way to merge
        things like the file system, the memory manager, and network file access. you can find the website,
        with more info and the design document, <a href="https://sugarfi.dev/qyre">here</a>.

        fyt is a small programming language, which i built to be that way on purpose, since limitations make
        programming more fun and more challenging. you can find documentation and the source code 
        <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/fyt">here</a>.

        emenu is a simple fork of dmenu that i made as a way to practice my x11 programming and to make
        a simpler, faster application launcher for myself. it doesn't do anything fancy, you configure it
        at compile time, and then it just works. you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/emenu">here</a>.

        bic is another suckless fork, this time of the sic irc client. it allows for formatting using markdown-like
        syntax, as well as colors and whatnot. it also colors the output. i don't often use irc, but when i do
        this is the client i use. source is <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/bic">here</a>.

        ew is a small package manager. it allows you to install packages entirely in a user directory, so no
        root access required, and it supports guix-like command chaining. also it's easy to host your own packages.
        source is <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/ew">here</a>.
