    the <a href="http://www.tif.org/lob/LOBbio.html">biography for lob on the instagon foundation website</a>
    contains this interesting snippet:
    <blockquote>
        LOB considers himself a "creatist".
        LOB believes in CREATIVITY as a devine path of wisdom.
        In the begining, the gods created all life as we know it.. to believe in creativity is to belive in that which the gods believed in. It is the closest path to godliness we as humans can tread upon.
        aArtists are usually attempting to portray or convey some sort of "impression" or idea. Although at times LOB finds excitment in the role of being an aArtist, he attempts more so to be a creatist, to make things up. The spontaneous essence of life is the spark of life itself.
        Creativity is the notion that one can be god like.. one can MAKE things.. one only needs to try...
        <br/>
        look how much has been created so far.

    i'm not very religious, i identify as atheist, but i still find this quote interesting. the comparison between
    creating simply for creations sake and 'playing god' fascinates me. i think i'm definitely more of a 'creatist'
    than an artist: not much that i make has some deeper meaning, most if it i just make for the sake of making it.
    so with that in mind, here's some of creatisms: (creatations?)

        novata is an ongoing net art-esque site (really closer to net creatism, but that's beside the point) featuring
        contributions from myself and others. the content ranges from dadaist detective mysteries to cutup poetry to simply
        pink rectangles. you can view it at <a href="https://novata.ninja">novata.ninja</a>.

        pung is a tool for converting a wav file to a png, so that one can apply visual effects to it, then convert it back
        to a wav file and hear what the various visual effects sound like. you can find the source
        <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/pung">here</a>.

        wall is a site i made as part of <a href="https://alto.sh">alto</a>, exploring the application of the idea of
        graffiti to the web. it allows you to in real time 'deface' various websites, and interact with others as
        they do the same. you can try it out at <a href="https://wall.novata.ninja">wall.novata.ninja</a>.

        the diary is a collaborative writing project, where users submit entries and every 24 hours one is chosen
        at random to further the story. unfortunately, it isn't very active at the moment, but you can view the
        existing entries and maybe even submit your own at <a href="https://diary.sugarfi.dev">diary.sugarfi.dev</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        a few experimental songs of sorts, which can be found both on novata and on youtube
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6kC30IFhA">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzsFV5B8thw">here</a>.
