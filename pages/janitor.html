    was messing around translating suburban lawn's song 'janitor' into toki pona:
</p>
<p style="white-space: pre">
tawa ale li tawa tu
kama seli, kama lili
mije li lawa ike
anpa telo, seli ala
ijo ala, ilo wawa sin
mu mu mu mu

a, mama sina li mama ante
mi la, ale li tan pilin
a, mama sina li mama ante
mi la, ale li tan pilin
a, mi jan telo, a sijelo mi
a, mi jan telo, a sijelo mi
a sijelo mi, a mi jan telo
</p>

    <summary>original lyrics from genius</summary>
    <p style="white-space: pre">
[Verse]
All action is reaction
Expansion, contraction
Man the manipulator
Underwater, does it matter?
Antimatter, nuclear reactor
Boom boom boom boom

[Chorus]
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
Oh my genitals, I'm a janitor

[Verse]
All action is reaction
Expansion, contraction
Man the manipulator
Underwater, does it matter?
Antimatter, nuclear reactor
Boom boom boom boom

[Chorus]
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
Oh my genitals, I'm a janitor

    i did just translate it from memory, based on what i thought the lyrics were.
    it turns out i misheard a few lines, but i like my version better so i'm keeping it.
    here is what i thought the lyrics were, if you're interested:
</p>
<p style="white-space: pre">
all action is reaction
expansion, contraction
men manipulate all
underwater, doesn't matter
antimatter, new new reactor (or smth idk)
boom boom boom boom

oh your mother was your father
i guess everything is relative
</p>

    also note that the song only works if you do the stress weirdly: sijelo has to be pronounced
    siJElo, rather than the correct SIjelo. and 'ilo wawa' probably isn't the best translation for
    'nuclear reactor', but whatever. my toki pona isn't the best. but hey, practice makes perfect,
    right?
