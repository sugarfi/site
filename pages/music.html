    you were expecting this to be a page of music i've made, weren't you? haha, jokes on you,
    i don't make music (very often)! this is a page about music i like.
</p>
<p>
    i'm a big fan of 70s, 80s, and 90s music, but i'll listen to stuff from any era really.
    my favorite bands at the moment are the cure, the smashing pumpkins, dead or alive (but
    mostly just because pete burns was pretty) and new order. i'm also a big fan of shoegaze,
    and i quite like my bloody valentine, pale saints, slowdive, and galaxie 500. sometimes
    i listen to some more experimental/noisy stuff, mainly throbbing gristle. i also enjoy
    the smiths and morrisey on occasion (yes i know morrisey is a fascist asshole, but he
    has a nice voice, ok?)

    if you have any recommendations for music you think i'll like (chances are i will),
    or just wanna talk about music in general, feel free to email music@sugarfi.dev or
    <a href="contact.html">contact me some other way</a>.
