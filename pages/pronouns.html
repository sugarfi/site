<p>
    my pronouns are she/her/hers/herself. i prefer feminine gendered terms to be used for me, like 'girl'
    rather than 'boy'. if a term is ambiguously gendered, like 'dude' or 'guy', i don't necessarily
    mind it being used, but i'd prefer for it not to be used or for a feminine term to be used if possible.
